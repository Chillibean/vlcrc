== Usage
{{nice name}} is a library for controlling VLC since a CLI would be redundant given that it uses VLC's built-in TCP interface anyway. To use this Ruby binding for the TCP interface, look at this to initialise the connection.

  require 'vlcrc'
  
  # Create a new VLC object, which attempts to connect
  vlc = VLCRC::VLC.new localhost, 1234
  
  # Launch an instance of VLC bound to the above socket
  vlc.launch
  
  # Connect to it (have to wait for it to launch though)
  until vlc.connected?
    sleep 0.1
    vlc.connect
  end

VLC can be configured to run with the RC interface open by default on a certain socket so that you can connect to instances of VLC that are already open. Note that different instances need to run on different sockets. Now that it's up and running,

  # Start playing a file
  vlc.media = "/path/to/a/video.avi"
  
  # Seek to the middle of the file
  middle = ( vlc.length / 2 ).round
  vlc.position = middle
  
  # Add a bunch of files and move around
  vlc.playlist = [
    "/path/to/first/file.avi",
    "/path/to/another/one.mkv",
    "/path/to/something/else.mp4"
  ]
  vlc.skip
  vlc.media   #=> "/path/to/another/one.mkv"
  
  # Stop the file
  vlc.playing = false
  
  # Close VLC
  vlc.exit
